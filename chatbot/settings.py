    Welcome to the settings module! Please take a minute to read
    this little introduction, if it's your first time here.
    
    If you've used Django before, this is familiar to you and 
    you can stop reading now. If you haven't, that's okay too. 
    
    Everything in this file is available to you in your app 
    through 'pyttman.settings'. You can store things here, but
    be >>> very careful <<< not to push API tokens, 
    passwords or other sensitive details to version control. 
    This is why it's recommended to use .env or another form 
    of storing these sensitive credentials in your app, and 
    then using them here in this file with `os.getenv("my_api_token")` 
    for example.
